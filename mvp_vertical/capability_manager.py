"""Capability management slice (Phase D).

A bounded, governed lifecycle for one capability at a time — the executable seam
for `COCKPIT_CAPABILITY_MANAGEMENT.md`. The manager inventories a capability,
authors a candidate action, obtains the Pantheon preflight through the chokepoint
(`policy_gate`), and asks an injected native executor to perform exactly one
operation, returning a technical receipt and a fresh observation.

It never executes a capability itself, routes no provider, installs nothing and
approves nothing. The native operation is performed by `executor`, external to
this manager; a consequential action runs only behind an allow verdict plus a
valid human decision (fail-closed). Distinctions held as data:

    installed != approved
    enabled != activated for a scope
    update_available != update_authorized
    technical receipt != evidence
    healthy != safe
