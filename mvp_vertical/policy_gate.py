"""Policy chokepoint seam (Phase C): a consequential effect routes through the
Pantheon policy check before it happens.

This repository does not embed the Pantheon policy service. It defines the seam
the runtime uses to consult a Policy Decision Point (Pantheon `mcp-server`) and
to enforce the verdict — the Policy Enforcement Point role. A real deployment
injects an HTTP client to that PDP; tests inject the deterministic stand-in
below.

Two rules make this a real chokepoint, not advice:

- **Fail closed.** If the policy client is unavailable, or the verdict is not a
  clear allow, the consequential effect is blocked and never runs.
- **Smart-approvals neutralized.** The seam never auto-approves. Only an eligible
  preflight *and* a valid human decision permit the effect; an in-runtime
  "smart approval" cannot substitute for the human decision.

`STAND-IN`: `StandInPolicyClient` occupies the PDP seat for offline tests. It is
not the Pantheon policy service:

    stand_in_policy_client != Pantheon PDP
