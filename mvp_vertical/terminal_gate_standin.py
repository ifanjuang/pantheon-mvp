"""Terminal decision-gate STAND-IN (adoption review, Gates 4 & 5).

This is NOT the OpenWebUI cockpit and NOT the final decision surface:

    terminal_gate != OpenWebUI cockpit

It stands in for the human decision gate so the governance cage can be proven
end to end. It reads the runner's candidate stream and records a human
decision as a schema-conforming ``decision_record``. It *records* a decision;
it never *executes* the decision's consequence — no send, no register write,
no memory promotion. Even ``approve`` authorizes nothing external:

    draft != external_send_authorization

System-signer refusal (Gate 5): the system may never sign. ``decided_by`` must
be supplied by a human and can neither default to nor be a system identity.
Without a human signer, the gate refuses.

Identity assurance (issue #13, P3): ``decided_by`` here is a *declared* string,
not an authenticated principal. Every record this stand-in emits therefore
carries ``identity_assurance: declared`` — it never claims ``authenticated``.
A future OpenWebUI decision surface, which holds an authenticated session,
would emit the same decision_record with ``identity_assurance: authenticated``
plus an ``authenticated_principal`` block, e.g.::

    identity_assurance: authenticated
    authenticated_principal:
      user_id: ...
      display_name: ...
      identity_provider: openwebui

That authentication is the cockpit's job. This repository does not implement
it, and this stand-in must not fabricate it:

    declared_identity != authenticated_principal

Decision identity (issue #13, P1): every recorded decision is a distinct event
with a unique ``decision_id`` (a content digest) and a microsecond
``recorded_at``; ``supersedes_decision_id`` links a revising decision to the
one it replaces. This stand-in *emits* distinct events; it does NOT persist
them, so it cannot itself guarantee an append-only history — that is a property
of the future decision store, not of this repository:

    distinct_events_emitted != append_only_history_guaranteed
