"""Block 3 — Register Candidate proposal (issue #13).

The only transition into the register is:

    Decision Record + decision == approve + retention_authorized == true
        -> Register Candidate

A Register Candidate is NOT a Register Entry, and retention_authorized is NOT
memory promotion. This module produces a schema-valid ``register_candidate`` as
DATA, linked to the exact decision record and to the digests of the content the
human reviewed. It writes nothing durable and promotes no memory:

    register_candidate != register_entry
    retention_authorized != memory_promoted
    decision_recorded != consequence_executed

``statement`` (what is retained), ``scope`` (where it applies) and
``retention_authorized`` (a human authorization, distinct from the approve
decision) are supplied by the human — never fabricated here.
