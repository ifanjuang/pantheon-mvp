"""Every startup migration must be lock-light, not just the Information one.

`initialize_composed_schema()` replays all of these on each service start. An
unguarded `ALTER TABLE` takes an ACCESS EXCLUSIVE lock even when it has nothing
to change, and a plain `ADD CONSTRAINT ... CHECK` re-scans the whole table every
time, so a boot can block behind — or block — live traffic.

`test_projection_startup_migration_remains_lock_light` already asserted this for
`information_projection` alone. Scoping the rule to one module let the next
migration reintroduce eight unguarded statements. This asserts it for the whole
startup set, discovered from the initializer rather than listed.

Guarded schema evolution stays allowed: an `ALTER TABLE` inside a `DO $$ ... $$`
block that first checks the catalog performs catalog reads only once applied.
