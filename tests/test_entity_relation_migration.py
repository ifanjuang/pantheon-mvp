"""The relation review migration must survive a database that already has rows.

Relations shipped without a review state: a relation was canonical the moment it
was written. Adding `proposed -> canonical -> retired` means adding a column to a
populated table and backfilling it, and the backfill is the dangerous half.

The first version of that migration died on every installation that already had a
relation, and no existing test could see it: the scope trigger installed by the
previous version accepts exactly one UPDATE shape — active to retired, advancing
the revision — and a backfill is neither. Every local database was empty, so the
UPDATE touched no rows and raised nothing.

This applies the previously shipped migration to a throwaway database, writes one
active and one retired relation through it, and only then applies the migration
under test. The shipped schema is an immutable fixture copied from commit
fa27ae9fd71d39e06c27271e2d3936c36284afb7, the parent of the relation-review
change introduced in #254.
