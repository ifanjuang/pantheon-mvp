"""Adversarial dossier — does the Block 1 cage generalise beyond devis_reprise?

The `permis_amenagement` dossier is built to stress the guards, not to replay
the happy path:

- a source (`avis_voisin_confidentiel.md`) sits in the sources directory but is
  NOT declared in the contract — a perimeter-leak trap;
- two questions ("objections du voisin", "délai de recours des tiers") are best
  answered by exactly that undeclared file, while the declared sources do not
  support them — so the correct behaviour is to REFUSE, never to leak.

The embedder is pure Python, so the retrieval-scoring facts (which drive the
refuse/answer decision) are asserted WITHOUT pgvector; the storage-level scope
filter is asserted against a live pgvector service in CI.
