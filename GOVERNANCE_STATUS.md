# Governance Status

Status: external executable candidate — implemented and tested / not adopted.

This repository is not Pantheon Next.

It is an external executable candidate intended to host the MVP vertical slice and bounded runtime adapters for governed task-loop testing.

## Boundary

```text
executed_by: this external repository and Hermes, only when explicitly installed/run
exposed_by: terminal decision stand-in, read-only OpenWebUI Document Card, optional Paperless Source Inbox, Document Runtime Status and Document Runtime Live Status candidates, mobile Knowledge editor candidate; not installed
governed_by: Pantheon Next doctrine and adoption gates
approved_by: human decision only; authenticated issuer verification is available when the PDP registry and signed decision path are configured
forbidden: self-approval, external send bypass, memory promotion, provider routing by Pantheon, scheduling by Pantheon, unrestricted source access
```

## Current status

```text

# The executable candidate remains aligned to the vendored Pantheon governed-loop
# schema at UPSTREAM_COMMIT e9c237bb3995deb68685b097edae98f8c0efb9ed.
# Newer upstream commits are drift signals and do not silently change this contract.

hermes_intelligent_edit_binding: polling_seam_implemented_not_connected

policy_chokepoint_seam: implemented_not_connected
# policy_gate normalizes runtime effects to the Pantheon request+gate_signals HTTP
# contract, fails closed and binds decision validation to PEP-derived effect facts.

policy_client_http: implemented_not_connected
capability_management_slice: implemented_not_connected
knowledge_update_chokepoint: wired_not_connected
capability_executor_http: implemented_transport_requires_verified_binding
# HermesCapabilityExecutor no longer invents /v1/capabilities:operate as a default.
# A caller must provide an explicitly reviewed native capability-operation endpoint.
# The verified Hermes Runs API is work execution, not install/enable/update semantics.

hermes_runs_api_observer: implemented_candidate_merged_not_connected
# Reads only Hermes /v1/capabilities and /v1/toolsets. It checks the public Runs API
# feature contract and compares concrete active tools to an explicit reviewed
# allowed/required tool policy. It never submits/stops/approves a run or changes
# activation. reachable != safe; Runs API available != run authorized.

hermes_run_launch_reservation: implemented_candidate_merged_not_connected
# One immutable reservation and bounded Launch Context Snapshot per admitted run.
# The candidate adds admitted -> launch_reserved -> consumed with lazy
# launch_expired projection. Reservation performs no runtime submission and creates
# no queue, scheduler or retry worker.

hermes_runs_external_binding: implemented_candidate_merged_not_connected
# The external Run Binding requires compatible Runs API + qualified concrete tool
# surface, reserves one launch, POSTs exactly one /v1/runs request and records the
# real run_id. Ambiguous network outcomes are never retried automatically. Model
# and provider routing remain inside Hermes.

hermes_active_context_bridge: implemented_candidate_merged_not_connected
# Resolves the exact running run server-side from the admission/session identity and
# delegates to Scoped Hermes Data Access. Caller/model supplies no run_id and gains
# no global Agency Data access.

hermes_context_plugin: implemented_candidate_merged_not_installed
# Candidate native Hermes plugin exposes only pantheon_context_manifest and
# pantheon_context_entity. Tool schemas contain no admission_id/run_id. Host task_id
# is used as the admission identity and must be admission-*. Upstream source maps a
# supplied Runs session_id to run_conversation task_id, but target behavior remains
# to verify before installation, enablement or activation.

hermes_run_launch_junction_ci: green_on_merged_candidate
# Runs observer and launch junction are merged in current main. Contract tests,
# current Paperless contracts and the full PostgreSQL suite pass. test_pass != adoption.

hermes_live_binding_acceptance: implemented_candidate_not_run
# Operator-only helper. Default mode is read-only Runs/toolset observation. A live
# run requires --ack SYNTHETIC_ONLY plus a pre-created synthetic admission whose
# question/root are explicitly synthetic and require both Pantheon context tools.
# PASS requires session echo, context-tool events, out-of-scope refusal, terminal
# reconciliation and active-context closure. Ambiguous launch states are preserved
# as inconclusive and never trigger automatic retry/stop/approval.

human_issuer_signing: implemented_not_connected
# decision_signing.py produces the HMAC signature matching Pantheon PDP issuer
# authentication. Signing authenticates who decided; it does not approve or
# authorize the effect. Key registry and live target wiring remain operator-side.

local_document_ingestion: implemented_candidate_not_deployed
# Governed local/NAS source ingestion remains available without Paperless through
# declared source paths, path-boundary checks, digests, Docling when selected and
# Project Document candidate creation.

document_source_management_slot: optional
preferred_document_source_binding: paperless_ngx
paperless_runtime_overlay: implemented_optional_not_selected_by_default
# compose.phase-b.yaml contains no Paperless-only required variables.
# compose.paperless.yaml adds Paperless, its DB/broker, bounded gateway and the
# binding-specific Hermes/observer configuration only when selected.

paperless_document_adapter: implemented_optional_not_deployed
paperless_gateway: implemented_optional_not_deployed
paperless_source_inbox: implemented_optional_not_installed

document_runtime_status: implemented_read_only_not_installed
# Paperless status is meaningful only when the optional binding is selected.
# Unselected Paperless is not_applicable, not degraded.

document_runtime_live_observations: implemented_read_only_not_deployed
# Independent PDP, Docling and Hermes observations remain active in the core.
# MVP_DOCUMENT_SOURCE_BINDING defaults to governed_local_source; paperless_ngx
# selects the bounded Paperless gateway observation.
# No synthetic global health is computed and no observation changes authority.

document_runtime_network_observer: implemented_candidate_not_deployed
# Uses server-side MVP_COCKPIT_API_KEY, PANTHEON_POLICY_API_KEY and
# HERMES_API_SERVER_KEY only inside the observer service. It projects bounded
# status and never exposes those credentials to the Cockpit response.

synthetic_document_runtime_check: implemented_candidate_not_run
# Operator-only helper. The existing exact-version Paperless synthetic path applies
# only when the Paperless binding is selected. Core local/NAS ingestion has its own
# governed source/path/digest contract and is not invalidated by Paperless absence.

phase_b_portainer_compose: implemented_candidate_not_deployed
# Core Phase B starts from compose.phase-b.yaml without Paperless variables.
# compose.paperless.yaml is added only when paperless_ngx is selected. Existing
# OpenWebUI/SearXNG remain external.

hermes_pantheon_document_intake_skill: implemented_optional_not_installed
# This Paperless-specific skill is installed/configured only when that binding is selected.

human_decision_issuer_authentication: implementation_available_not_connected
# Pantheon PDP can verify issuer signatures when a read-only issuer key registry is
# configured, and this repo contains the matching decision-signing producer. The
# target path has not yet proven registry configuration + signed decision delivery.
```

None of these statuses establishes target health, installed Hermes skills/plugins, live PDP/PEP enforcement, authenticated target issuer, adopted Runs binding, activation or real-dossier authorization.

## Final rule

```text
This repository may execute an external proof loop.
Paperless is an optional source-management binding, not a prerequisite for document ingestion.
Pantheon Next governs the status of that loop.
The human decides.
